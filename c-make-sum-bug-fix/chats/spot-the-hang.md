This C program adds all numbers from 1 to a user provided input. When you run the program, the console will prompt you for an integer input. The program will then calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to the provided number and print the result.

However, if you terminate the process before it completes, you will see the "make: *** [run] Terminated:15" message, indicating that the make command did not finish executing the 'run' target because of a received signal to terminate (signal 15).

The provided C code:

- Declares a function `makeSum(int max)` that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to `max`. It initializes the `sum` variable to 0 and then uses a while loop to add each integer from 1 up to (but not including) `max` to `sum`.

- Defines the `main` function, which first declares two integer variables: `input`, to hold the number inputted by the user, and `sum`, to store the result of `makeSum`. Then, `scanf` reads an integer from standard input (the number the user inputs) and stores it in `input`. `sum` is then set to the result of `makeSum(input)`, and the output ("Sum from 1 to input is sum.") is printed to the console.

Running the `make run` command executes the "run" target of the Makefile, which usually includes links to the program's source files, instructions for compiling them, and any necessary flags or options. However, the 'make run' process may get interrupted due to either an externally triggered termination (like you manually stopping it) or an internal program error. The latter doesn't seem to be the case given the provided code snippet.

right

% make run
./makeSum
3
Sum from 1 to 3 is 3.



# assistant

Great! After you executed the command "make run", you were prompted to enter an integer. You entered "3". 

The program then calculated and displayed the sum of all integers from 1 to 3, which is 3 (1 + 2 = 3). Please note that the entered number itself (here, 3) is not included in the sum according to the current implementation of the `makeSum(int max)` function. 

If you want to include the entered number itself, you need to change the condition in the while loop in the `makeSum` function from `i < max` to `i <= max`. Making this change will make the program add the numbers from 1 up to and including `max` to the sum. Then, if you enter "3", the result will be 6 (1 + 2 + 3 = 6).

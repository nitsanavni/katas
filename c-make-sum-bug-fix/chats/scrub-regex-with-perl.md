use ack (grep) to replace the found regex with some constant


# assistant

If you want to replace some text with some other text in the files using a command line tool, you can use tools like `sed`, `awk` or `perl`. `ack` is a tool designed for efficient searching, but not for in-place editing.

However, you could use the results from `ack` with other tools e.g. `perl` to perform in-place editing.

For example, if you want to replace all occurrences of 'foo' with 'bar' in all .txt files, you could do this:

```bash
ack -l 'foo' *.txt | xargs perl -pi -e 's/foo/bar/g'
```

Explanation:

- `ack -l 'foo' *.txt`: list files(*.txt) which contain 'foo'
- `|`: Pipe the result to the next command
- `xargs`: Build and execute command line from standard input
- `perl -pi -e 's/foo/bar/g'`: Perl command to replace 'foo' with 'bar' in-place (i.e., changing the original file)

Remember to back up files when performing in-place changes, as mistakes can't be undone.

Please note that regex replacements are sensitive to certain characters such as slashes, backreference and others, which may need to be escaped. Consider reading more about Perl regex substitution and escaping special characters for further details.

don't replace in-place, instead we want to pass through stdin with our edits


# assistant

To replace text via stdin without modifying the files in place, you can pipe the output of `ack`(or whichever command you're using to get the original data) into `perl`, `sed`, or similar. Here's an example using `perl`:

```bash
echo "some sample text with foo" | perl -pe 's/foo/bar/g'
```

This will display "some sample text with bar" to your command line.

So if you wanted to search for 'foo' in your text files with `ack`, replace 'foo' with 'bar', and output the result to stdout:

```bash
ack --no-filename --output='$&' 'foo' *.txt | perl -pe 's/foo/bar/g'
```

In this command:

- `--output='$&'` is used to print every match of `ack` command.
- `'foo'` is the search pattern.
- `*.txt` are the files in which you want to search.
- `| perl -pe 's/foo/bar/g'` replacing 'foo' with 'bar' using perl.

Please note that the outputs from `ack` or `perl` commands in these examples contain only matched lines or replaced lines, not the whole content of the files. If you want to see the whole content with replacements, consider using `cat` instead of `ack`.

```bash
cat *.txt | perl -pe 's/foo/bar/g'
```

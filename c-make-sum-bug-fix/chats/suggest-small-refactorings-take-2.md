Here are a few small revisions you could make. Some may not necessarily improve the code, but are slight changes to enhance clarity or readability.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int compute_sum(int max) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= max; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}

int main(void) {
    int input;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &input);
    printf("The sum from 1 to %d is %d.\n", input, compute_sum(input));
    return 0;
}
```
Points to note:
1. Renamed the function `makeSum` to `compute_sum` for increased readability and clarity.
2. Added a prompt for the user to enter a number, before `scanf` in `main()`.
3. Combined the variable declaration and initialisation in the compute_sum function.
4. Formatting - added spaces around operators for consistency and clarity.
5. Renamed the variable `max` to a more descriptive name like `upper_limit`, `end_value`, etc according to its usage and purpose in the system. Here we are not renaming because, max seems okay and going with the simple example provided.
6. Comments are not added considering the clarity of the code implmentation. For complex calculations, always provide comments to explain the logic/implementation.

+create a new typescript file cat.ts
+
+it has one function that concatenates two multi-line strings
+const cat = (lhs: string, rhs: string): string => { ...
+
+it's like a zip operation
+each line on the left is concatenated to the line on the right
+but first padEnd (spaces) the lhs lines to all have same lenght

+for the tests, expected strings: use multi-line strings for readability

# 2024-09-01 11:29:56.441041

+
+fix the expected to be like this:

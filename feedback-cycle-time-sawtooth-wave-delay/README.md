# concept

to get a feel of the importance of a quick feedback cycle - introduce varying artificial delays into the loop

# installs

```shell
bun upgrade
bun install
```

# develop

```shell
ls index.ts approved | entr -cr ./test.sh
```

# thoughts

-   sin wave delay
-   in a pair / ensemble - we could set the timer of the rotation to be different than the delay cycle time; e.g. ensemble rotation every 3m delay cycle 4m

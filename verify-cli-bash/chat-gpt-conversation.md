yes, I'd like some help with bash scripting
Sure, I'd be happy to help with bash scripting. Bash is a popular Unix shell and command language, and it is often used for writing scripts that automate common tasks on a computer. If you have a specific question about bash scripting, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help.

I'd like to test this script from another script - 'test.sh'
To test a script from another script in bash, you can use the source command to execute the script within the current shell environment. This allows you to access the functions and variables defined in the script, as if they had been defined in the current script. Here is an example of how you could use the source command to test a script called test.sh:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script to be tested

source test.sh

# Call a function defined in the script

test_function
You can also use the . (dot) command in place of the source command to achieve the same effect.

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script to be tested

. test.sh

# Call a function defined in the script

test_function
Note that the source and . commands are equivalent, but the source command is more commonly used. Also, when using the source or . commands, you should specify the path to the script if it is not in the current directory. For example:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script to be tested

source /path/to/test.sh

# Call a function defined in the script

test_function
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

got it
is there a way to pass in stdin into the sourced sript?
Yes, you can pass standard input (stdin) to a script that is sourced by another script in bash. To do this, you can use the << (here-string) redirection operator to pass a string as standard input to the script. Here is an example of how you could use the << operator to pass standard input to a sourced script:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script to be tested

source test.sh

# Pass a string as standard input to the script

test_function << EOF
This is a test
EOF
In the example above, the string This is a test will be passed as standard input to the test_function function defined in the test.sh script. You can also use the <<< (here-string) operator to pass a string as standard input to a sourced script, like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script to be tested

source test.sh

# Pass a string as standard input to the script

test_function <<< "This is a test"
Note that the << and <<< operators are similar, but the <<< operator does not require a delimiter (such as EOF) to mark the end of the string.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

cool
can we pass in stdin to the top level script rather than into a function?
Yes, you can pass standard input (stdin) to the top-level script in bash. To do this, you can use the << (here-string) redirection operator to pass a string as standard input to the script. Here is an example of how you could use the << operator to pass standard input to a top-level script:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Read standard input

read -r input

# Print the input

echo "$input"
In the example above, the read command is used to read standard input and store it in a variable called input. Then, the echo command is used to print the contents of the input variable.

To pass a string as standard input to the script, you can use the << operator like this:

Copy code

# Pass a string as standard input to the script

./script.sh << EOF
This is a test
EOF
In the example above, the string This is a test will be passed as standard input to the script.sh script. You can also use the <<< (here-string) operator to pass a string as standard input to a script, like this:

Copy code

# Pass a string as standard input to the script

./script.sh <<< "This is a test"
Note that the << and <<< operators are similar, but the <<< operator does not require a delimiter (such as EOF) to mark the end of the string.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

yes, I'd like some help with bash scripting
Sure, I'd be happy to help with bash scripting. Bash is a popular Unix shell and command language, and it is often used for writing scripts that automate common tasks on a computer. If you have a specific question about bash scripting, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help.

I'd like to test this script from another script - 'test.sh'
To test a script from another script in bash, you can use the source command to execute the script within the current shell environment. This allows you to access the functions and variables defined in the script, as if they had been defined in the current script. Here is an example of how you could use the source command to test a script called test.sh:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script to be tested

source test.sh

# Call a function defined in the script

test_function
You can also use the . (dot) command in place of the source command to achieve the same effect.

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script to be tested

. test.sh

# Call a function defined in the script

test_function
Note that the source and . commands are equivalent, but the source command is more commonly used. Also, when using the source or . commands, you should specify the path to the script if it is not in the current directory. For example:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script to be tested

source /path/to/test.sh

# Call a function defined in the script

test_function
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

got it
is there a way to pass in stdin into the sourced sript?
Yes, you can pass standard input (stdin) to a script that is sourced by another script in bash. To do this, you can use the << (here-string) redirection operator to pass a string as standard input to the script. Here is an example of how you could use the << operator to pass standard input to a sourced script:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script to be tested

source test.sh

# Pass a string as standard input to the script

test_function << EOF
This is a test
EOF
In the example above, the string This is a test will be passed as standard input to the test_function function defined in the test.sh script. You can also use the <<< (here-string) operator to pass a string as standard input to a sourced script, like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script to be tested

source test.sh

# Pass a string as standard input to the script

test_function <<< "This is a test"
Note that the << and <<< operators are similar, but the <<< operator does not require a delimiter (such as EOF) to mark the end of the string.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

cool
can we pass in stdin to the top level script rather than into a function?
Yes, you can pass standard input (stdin) to the top-level script in bash. To do this, you can use the << (here-string) redirection operator to pass a string as standard input to the script. Here is an example of how you could use the << operator to pass standard input to a top-level script:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Read standard input

read -r input

# Print the input

echo "$input"
In the example above, the read command is used to read standard input and store it in a variable called input. Then, the echo command is used to print the contents of the input variable.

To pass a string as standard input to the script, you can use the << operator like this:

Copy code

# Pass a string as standard input to the script

./script.sh << EOF
This is a test
EOF
In the example above, the string This is a test will be passed as standard input to the script.sh script. You can also use the <<< (here-string) operator to pass a string as standard input to a script, like this:

Copy code

# Pass a string as standard input to the script

./script.sh <<< "This is a test"
Note that the << and <<< operators are similar, but the <<< operator does not require a delimiter (such as EOF) to mark the end of the string.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

ok, I'm trying this now
I'm glad I could help! If you have any other questions or need any additional assistance with bash scripting, feel free to ask. I'll do my best to help.

here's what I have:
in file 'test':

```
#!/bin/bash

./verify <<< "This is a test"

```

and in file 'verify':

```
#!/bin/bash

# Read standard input
read -r input

# Print the input
echo "input: $input"

```

when I run `./test`, I get this output:

```
input: This is a test
```

Yes, that looks correct. In the test script, you are using the <<< operator to pass the string This is a test as standard input to the verify script. Then, in the verify script, the read command is used to read the standard input and store it in the input variable, and the echo command is used to print the contents of the input variable.

If you want to pass standard input to a function defined in the verify script, you can do that by using the << (here-string) redirection operator and passing the string as standard input to the function, like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script containing the function

source verify.sh

# Pass a string as standard input to the function

test_function << EOF
This is a test
EOF
In the example above, the test_function function defined in the verify.sh script will receive the string This is a test as standard input. You can also use the <<< operator to pass a string as standard input to a function, like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script containing the function

source verify.sh

# Pass a string as standard input to the function

test_function <<< "This is a test"
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

yes, now let's pass in a multi-line string, can we use 'seq 4' to generate the input for example?
Yes, you can pass a multi-line string as standard input to a script or function in bash. To do this, you can use the << (here-string) redirection operator and specify the multi-line string in the operator, like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script containing the function

source verify.sh

# Pass a multi-line string as standard input to the function

test_function << EOF
1
2
3
4
EOF
In the example above, the test_function function defined in the verify.sh script will receive the four-line string 1\n2\n3\n4 as standard input. You can also use the <<< operator to pass a multi-line string as standard input to a function, like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script containing the function

source verify.sh

# Pass a multi-line string as standard input to the function

test_function <<< "1
2
3
4"
Note that when using the << or <<< operators, you must specify the delimiter (such as EOF) to mark the end of the string if you are using the << operator.

If you want to generate the multi-line string using the seq command, you can do that like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Generate a multi-line string using the seq command

input=$(seq 4)

# Pass the multi-line string as standard input to the function

test_function <<< "$input"
In the example above, the seq command is used to generate a four-line string containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then the <<< operator is used to pass the string as standard input to the test_function function.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

nitsanav@gmail.com
can we inline the 'input' var?
Yes, you can inline the input variable when passing a multi-line string as standard input to a script or function in bash. To do this, you can use the <<< (here-string) operator and specify the multi-line string directly in the operator, like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script containing the function

source verify.sh

# Pass a multi-line string as standard input to the function

test_function <<< "1
2
3
4"
In the example above, the test_function function defined in the verify.sh script will receive the four-line string 1\n2\n3\n4 as standard input. You can also use the << operator to pass a multi-line string as standard input to a function, like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script containing the function

source verify.sh

# Pass a multi-line string as standard input to the function

test_function << EOF
1
2
3
4
EOF
Note that when using the << or <<< operators, you must specify the delimiter (such as EOF) to mark the end of the string if you are using the << operator.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

got it, I'd still like to use `seq 4`, with the inlined version
To use the seq command to generate a multi-line string and pass it as standard input to a script or function in bash, you can use the <<< operator and specify the seq command directly in the operator, like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Source the script containing the function

source verify.sh

# Pass a multi-line string generated by the seq command as standard input to the function

test_function <<< "$(seq 4)"
In the example above, the seq command is used to generate a four-line string containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then the <<< operator is used to pass the string as standard input to the test_function function defined in the verify.sh script.

Note that when using the <<< operator, you do not need to specify a delimiter (such as EOF) to mark the end of the string, because the <<< operator automatically terminates the string at the end of the line.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

nitsanav@gmail.com
I changed the code to:
./verify <<< "$(seq 4)"

now I get this output:
$ ./test
input: 1

can we capture the whole input string (multi-line) in the verify script?
Yes, you can capture a multi-line string as standard input in a bash script and store it in a variable. To do this, you can use the read command with the -d option, which specifies a delimiter to use to terminate the input. Here is an example of how you could use the read command with the -d option to capture a multi-line string as standard input and store it in a variable:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Read standard input with a delimiter

read -d '' input

# Print the input

echo "input: $input"
In the example above, the read command is used to read standard input and store it in the input variable, using the empty string ('') as the delimiter to terminate the input. This allows the read command to capture the entire multi-line string as standard input, including newline characters.

If you want to pass a multi-line string as standard input to the verify script using the <<< operator, you can do that like this:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Pass a multi-line string as standard input to the script

./verify <<< "$(seq 4)"
In the example above, the seq command is used to generate a four-line string containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then the <<< operator is used to pass the string as standard input to the verify script.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about bash scripting.

works great, now I get:
$ ./test
input: 1
2
3
4

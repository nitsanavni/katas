- we could be even more productive by installing plugins etc.
- If we had the rig h pairing, it could be ??? very fluid.  Especially if fluent in CLI-ish tools.
- Clunky to get gitpod-ssh going.  Can automate this part (especially since we've got 1 (or 2) automators who are lazy!)
- On local environment, has copilot inside nvim(1).  Could pair with all the best AI's. (and HI's)
- Idea - API for voice mode inside CLI-driven tools.  Unholy bastard?  Holy union?  Blinded me with Science!!!
- Franken-IDE

- Reflecting...
- nice to be able to speak at the exact level of understanding: e.g. PS1 / PS2, pytest, copy the whole paragraph, asserts...
- means we can focus on the novelty: tmux
- what are we sharing? fs, screen
- is that helpful?
- emacs fingers **and** vi fingers is huge
- mine, yours, ours | Michael, Nitsan, bash | emacs, vi, bash
- muscle memory serves us
- reminds me of .dotfiles repos

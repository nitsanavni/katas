-   roman numerals are still decimal, each decimal digit is independently represented in the roman
    -   77 could've been written like this: VIIVII
    -   they're missing the zero!! how do you differentiate between 1 and 10 and 100
    -   if we had zero we could do: 70 -> VII0
    -   we'd also have problem separating digits - what does VIV mean? 54? 65?
    -   so instead of zero, a separator - | !!
    -   70 -> VII|, 54 -> V|IV, 65 -> VI|V, 100 -> I||, 1 -> I, 10 -> I|, 11 -> I|I, 2 -> II

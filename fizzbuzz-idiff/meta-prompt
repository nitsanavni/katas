the purpose of this script is to call chatgpt using the `chat` cli script (example bellow) in order to prompt it to name a commit

call the new script `commit-msg`

it uses the following commands:

## chat

this script all the openai api and gets a response

```shell
$ chat hello
Hello! How can I assist you today?
```

## other tools to use

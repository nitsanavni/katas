# Some Thoughts

- Do we even need the 'Executable Command' pattern here?
  - I'm failing to see where it comes into play
- `Sandbox` terminology +1
- `verify(git_diff())` after refactoring +1
- I forget, is there a way to clear dangling approved files?
- get rename suggestions one at a time w/o having the prev renames in the history creates waste
  - maybe better to ask for many renames at once, maybe a few per symbol
- `Sandbox` is doing a bit too much
  - What are the responsibilities here?
    - Sandbox
      - Executing shell commands
        - Running tests
        - Git things
    - The contents of the code project themselves
    - Chat interface
    - A refactoring system
      - Refactoring decision engine
        - Prompt
          - Make space for reasoning
            - evaluate the repo
              - smells
            - candidates
            - evaluate/score the candidates
            - choose
            - imagine the result
        - Parse response
      - Refactoring actions
        - Rename
      - Workflow
        - Stay in the Green
        - Commit
        - Make one refactoring at a time
        - Ask the human
        - Have a goal

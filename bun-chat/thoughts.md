-   I feel like there's a workflow to be developed here
    -   gpt takes some of the mental load off us when evaluating large texts
        -   subsequent runs could use diffs as part of the prompt
    -   `verify(result)`
        -   it could be approved already - in that case is passes - a quick pass (like in command approvals)
        -   it could have a diff - we first feed this diff through gpt
            -   we choose the more compact of the two representations
                -   approved + diff
                -   approved + received
        -   code diff could also be part of the context
        -

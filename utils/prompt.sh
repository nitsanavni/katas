continue the fizzbuzz kata - up to 4
only do the above, nothing else
use TDD
the code is in fizzbuzz_kata/, cd just once, you're using a shell
always read code before changing it
also - run the tests as often as possible - just run `pytest` - before and after each change
work in tiny steps
validate after each step
change code by overwriting complete files, don't attempt to change code in place
keep files very small

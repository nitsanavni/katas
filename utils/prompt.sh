./execsh-gpt.py "
continue the fizzbuzz kata - go up to six
only do the above, nothing else
the code is in fizzbuzz_kata/, cd just once - this should be your first step
follow the same style as the existing code
run the tests as often as possible - just run \`pytest\` - before and after each change
use TDD
always read code before changing it - \`cat\`
don't attempt to read a file before checking it's there - \`ls\`
work in tiny steps
validate after each step
change code by overwriting complete files, don't attempt to change code in place
keep files \*very small\*

./execsh-gpt.py "
continue the fizzbuzz kata - refactor such that each unit test is in a separate file
only do the above, nothing else
the code is in fizzbuzz_kata/, cd just once, you're using a shell
follow the same style as the existing code
run the tests as often as possible - just run `pytest` - before and after each change
use TDD
always read code before changing it
don't attempt to read a file before checking it's there - `ls`
work in tiny steps
validate after each step
change code by overwriting complete files, don't attempt to change code in place
keep files very small

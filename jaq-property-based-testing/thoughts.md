-   jaq can be fed input in a streaming way
-   fast-check happens in js, has to call a js function
-   can call jaq as child process
    -   can do it per property function call
    -   can do it once, and then just feed more input into jaq
-   can use bun, spawn, ts
-   can use dependencies as dut
-   looking at previous attempts at this problem, looks like building the arbitraries make for most of the heavy lifting of this problem
-   can approvals be used for the arbitraries themselves?

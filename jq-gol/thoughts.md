- test infra: don't verify if jaq errors
- GOL: inputs and output
- recurse, where output gets fed back as input
- can have a similar structure as done before:
  - `method` - test some method
  - `input` - the input to the method
  - `skip`, `focus`
  - tests.json, test-command.jq
  - each test in the tests.json, gets transformed to a command, allowing to run a specific method from cli
  - think about using fzf!

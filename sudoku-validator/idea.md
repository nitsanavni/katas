This will require you to develop classes and methods for each type of piece, to handle input and output, and to check for errors in movement and game state. It's also scalable - if you finish the basics, you can add more advanced features like castling, stalemate conditions, pawn promotion, etc."

Create a function which takes as input a two-dimensional array representing a Sudoku board and determines whether it's a valid solution or not. A valid solution means that no number from 1-9 is repeated in any row, any column or any 3x3 grid. You can make the assumption that you'll always get a 9x9 array."

- [selectively](test_fizzbuzz.py#L52) verifying from the 1-100 range
- [list comprehension](test_fizzbuzz.py#L12) with side effects instead of for loop
- single file, w/ different entry points
  - `pytest` - runs the [tests](./test_fizzbuzz.py#L29)
  - `python __file__` - run the [program](./test_fizzbuzz.py#L11)
- [lambda](./test_fizzbuzz.py#L22) for making the `approvals.Options` object
  - can't instantiate from global
  - not sure exactly why not, prob `Options` need access to the test / docstring...
    - ~~yes~~ - `InlineComparator` is doing `get_test_method_doc_string()` - it's not the cause
    - found it - it's actually the `InlinePythonReporter` - it's [doing too much in the ctor](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Python/blob/2a1770db597cb38ef996f4ac0385d4c11eb04334/approvaltests/namer/inline_python_reporter.py#L11)
- language - python - [`import ...`**_` as `_**`...`](./test_fizzbuzz.py#L17) like in Typescript
- e2e test, runs the script as a [child process](./test_fizzbuzz.py#L26)
- [inline + auto](./test_fizzbuzz.py#L22) approvals is a powerful combo

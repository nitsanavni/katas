> You can use the subprocess.Popen class to launch two separate subprocesses, and then use the communicate() method to send input to each process and receive output. Here's an example of how you might use Popen to coordinate two subprocesses in a simple two-player game:
>
> ```python
> import subprocess
>
> # Launch the first subprocess
> player1 = subprocess.Popen(['player1_program'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
>
> # Launch the second subprocess
> player2 = subprocess.Popen(['player2_program'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
>
> # Send input to the first subprocess and receive output
> player1_output = player1.communicate(input='player1_input')[0]
>
> # Send input to the second subprocess and receive output
> player2_output = player2.communicate(input='player2_input')[0]
> ```
>
> # Repeat the above steps as necessary to continue the game
>
> You can also use the Popen.poll() method to check the return code of the process and see if it is still running.

> It's important to note that communicate() method will wait for the process to terminate, if you want to avoid it you can use Popen.stdin and Popen.stdout attributes directly.

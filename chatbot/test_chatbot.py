    Test run completed. Likely it has failed because the add function isn't defined yet.
    
    
            As expected, the test failed because the `add` function is not defined. Let's proceed with
            the TDD process by implementing a simple `add` function that returns the sum of two numbers.
            
            We'll create a file named `add.py` in the `./add_two_numbers` folder to contain our
            function.

            Now that we have implemented the `add` function, we need to update our test file to import
            this function. Without the import, our test will still fail because it does not know where
            to find the `add` function.

            expectation.

            Great! The test has passed, indicating that our `add` function is correctly implemented
            according to the initial test case. This is a fundamental example of the Test-Driven
            Development (TDD) process, where we:
            
            1. Wrote a test that failed because the functionality was not implemented.
            2. Implemented the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
            3. Verified that the test passed.

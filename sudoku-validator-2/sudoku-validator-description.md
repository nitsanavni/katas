# Sudoku Solution Validator

Create a program that validates a given Sudoku puzzle solution.

Create a function which takes as input a two-dimensional array representing a Sudoku board and determines whether it's a valid solution or not. A valid solution means that no number from 1-9 is repeated in any row, any column or any 3x3 grid. You can make the assumption that you'll always get a 9x9 array.

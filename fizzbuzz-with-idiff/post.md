# TDD with Orange, Green, Refactor

Let's discuss preparatory refactorings and how they relate to TDD.

## I was fizzbuzzing along

I was working on the [fizzbuzz](https://github.com/nitsanavni/katas/tree/main/fizzbuzz-with-idiff) kata today using the jq language. Katas are repeated exercises, that help focus on many aspects and skills related to the craft of software development. [Fizzbuzz](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/fizzbuzz.html) is one such kata that I like in particular, and it's great for practicing TDD. Jq is a programming language for processing JSON documents in the cli and in scripts, but it's expressive enough to solve these kinds of exercises.

At some point during the implementation I wanted to ["make the change easy"](https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/250733358307500032?s=20).

The way I've built up the functionality was by extending the range of inputs I was approval-testing - with each TDD iteration the range increases by 1. Meaning - the first testing iteration was for `fizzbuzz(1)`, the next added the `2` - `fizzbuzz(1, 2)` (pseudo speaking), etc.

Now I had gone up to `5`, and the code looked something like this:

```jq
def fizz: { d: 3, c: "Fizz" };
def buzz: { d: 5, c: "Buzz" };

def fizzbuzz:
  if . == fizz.d then fizz.c
  elif . == buzz.d then buzz.c
  else .
  end;
```

It was time for **Red** again, so I've extended the test to include `6`:

```diff
- range(5) + 1 | fizzbuzz
+ range(6) + 1 | fizzbuzz
```

And it goes -

```diff
@@ -3,3 +3,4 @@
 Fizz
 4
 Buzz
+6
```

Great ape (me):

> Right... ðŸ¤”  
> ... I think that should be...  
> Fizz again  
> ...  
> I know how to do that!

```diff
@@ -2,7 +2,7 @@ def fizz: {d:3,c:"Fizz"};
 def buzz: {d:5,c:"Buzz"};

 def fizzbuzz:
-  if . == fizz.d then fizz.c
+  if . % fizz.d == 0 then fizz.c
   elif . == buzz.d then buzz.c
   else .
   end;
```

And as I started typing this wonderful solution, I thought:

> Wait! Can I make this change easy?  
> ... _How_ can I make this change easy?

## But... I shouldn't refactor while in Red

And now I got into an internal dialog loop.

Here is sample of my conflicting thoughts:

-   Getting to Green requires writing the simplest code possible, as I did above. However, this approach doesn't necessarily make the change easy.
-   What does "easy" even mean in this context? I was imagining an obvious and natural place to host and isolate the change - e.g. a new function\* like:

    ```jq
    def condition(d): . == d;
    ```

    It would later become:

    ```diff
    - def condition(d): . == d;
    + def condition(d): . % d == 0;
    ```

    In some sense, it's an "easier" change than my original trivial change (directly changing the code in the `fizzbuzz` function).

    \* jq doesn't really have "functions" per se, but it does have "filters" which for the purposes of this discussion serve the same function (he he).

-   Refactoring, including "making changes easy", should be done when tests are passing
-   On the other hand, "making the change easy" is about the state of the code _before_ the change, not after it
-   Deciding on the next micro-requirement is done using a new failing test
-   An even stronger statement - **the impetus for changing the code's behavior comes from a failing test**. It is our constant reminder and driver towards the next micro increment.
-   I don't want to refactor in Red

## What are my options?

I could refactor in Red.

I could disable the failing test, and refactor in Green.

I could make the failing test pass with the minimal simplest change, and then refactor.

None of those options is what I want in the context of "making the change easy".

## Preparatory Refactorings

Actually, there are two kinds refactorings.

### 1. General

General betterment of the code for prosperity (e.g. readability). Preparing for change _in general_.

For example renaming

### 2. Preparatory

Preparing for a _specific_ change - the next (micro) requirement

The first should be done in Green, meaning _all_ tests passing.  
The second, I propose, should be done in _Orange_.

## Orange, not Red

'Orange' is a state where:

> 1. All previous tests are passing
> 2. One new test is failing, knowingly, expectedly and for a known, expected reason

As opposed to 'Red' being:

> -   Some tests fail

## Testing Frameworks

Some testing frameworks like [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/main/docs/01-writing-tests.md#failing-tests) have the notion of failing tests - they are expected to fail, and cause an error if they pass.

With approval tests there's a pattern I like where an incorrect result is intentionally, temporarily approved so that when the behavior is implemented the change is highlighted by the diff tool.

Here's how it looks like for our failing test for `fizzbuzz(6)`.

First we temporarily approve the incorrect result of `6` (should be `Fizz`):

```diff
@@ -3,3 +3,4 @@
 Fizz
 4
 Buzz
+6
```

We're now in _Orange_.  
Admittedly this is not fully supported by the framework. I would have liked it to be an explicit state. It is only a mental state as of now.

Now we supposedly make the change easy, with a **preparatory refactoring**.

Introduce a function `condition`:

```diff
@@ -1,6 +1,8 @@
 def fizz: { d: 3, c: "Fizz" };
 def buzz: { d: 5, c: "Buzz" };

+def condition(d): . == d;
+
 def fizzbuzz:
   if . == fizz.d then fizz.c
   elif . == buzz.d then buzz.c
```

Use it:

```diff
@@ -4,5 +6,5 @@
 def fizzbuzz:
-  if . == fizz.d then fizz.c
+  if condition(fizz.d) then fizz.c
   elif . == buzz.d then buzz.c
   else .
   end;
```

Now, make the easy change:

```diff
@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@
 def fizz: { d: 3, c: "Fizz" };
 def buzz: { d: 5, c: "Buzz" };

-def condition(d): . == d;
+def condition(d): . % d == 0;

 def fizzbuzz:
   if condition(fizz.d) then fizz.c
```

Our approval test fails and highlights a good diff:

```diff
@@ -3,4 +3,4 @@
 Fizz
 4
 Buzz
-6
+Fizz
```

We approve this, and we're back to _Green_.

And now we can **refactor generally**, for example extract another method `isMultiple`:

```diff
@@ -1,7 +1,8 @@
 def fizz: { d: 3, c: "Fizz" };
 def buzz: { d: 5, c: "Buzz" };

-def condition(d): . % d == 0;
+def isMultiple(d): . % d == 0;
+def condition(d): isMultiple(d);

 def fizzbuzz:
   if condition(fizz.d) then fizz.c
```

## Conclusion

Sometimes one might want to **refactor** towards a specific change, driven by an intentionally failing test.  
That's the **Orange** state of TDD.
